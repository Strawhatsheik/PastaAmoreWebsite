Pasta Amore is a website I made for GRA-310 Digital Graphic Design for Web. I developed the code in CSS3 and HTML5 in Brackets. This exercise was good experience for me as while I had experience in these languages and website design from my Associates, this class taught me how to use stylesheets, rather than have all the information placed manually in the main HTML document.
It also covered SEO in depth, product research, and XML for site maps. While we students were given a style portfolio to follow, the pictures and site design were left to us. I started by hand drawn site layouts, moved up to a flowsheet, and built my site from there. At all times I stuck to the style guide in font and color choice. However pictures were not provided, so I went on Pixabay and dug through their free to use archives for pictures that carried just the right ambiance.

Further, this class had us use a FTPS (file transfer protocol service) and actually host our website, rather than send the teacher the base pages to go over. Overall it gave me a strong feel for working with a customer from conception to final product. 

Below are the wireframes/flowsheets, and different logos I created in Photoshop.
